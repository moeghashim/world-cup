# Building A World Cup Prediction And Sponsor Rewards Website

Last updated: 2026-06-01

This is the working blog post for the project. Update this file on every commit so the article stays aligned with the real build history.

## The Idea

The product started as a World Cup prediction website where fans choose the team they support, predict match outcomes, and become eligible for sponsor-funded rewards when they are right. The rewards concept has three parts:

- match-level draws with around 5-10 winners per match
- sponsor product packages shipped to winners
- free localized supporter T-shirts themed around the user's chosen team

Winners should also be prompted to review sponsor products after delivery. That means the product is not just a prediction game. It is a full loop: predict, draw, fulfill, review.

## Early Product Shape

The project began in an empty folder, so the first step was to scaffold a Vite, React, and TypeScript app. The first usable screen was intentionally not a marketing landing page. It became the prediction experience itself:

- supporter team selection
- team-themed UI
- match prediction cards
- score inputs
- winner picks
- locked predictions
- sponsor reward panels

The project also generated a cinematic stadium hero image and saved it at `src/assets/world-cup-hero.png`. The asset gives the site tournament energy without using official FIFA, tournament, sponsor, player, or federation marks.

## Why Team Theming Is Data-Driven

The supporter team choice controls the visual theme. Each team has a typed theme object in `src/data/worldCup.ts`:

- team name and code
- supporter chant
- mood description
- primary, secondary, accent, ink, and soft colors
- supporter stats

React maps the selected team into CSS variables:

```css
--team-primary
--team-secondary
--team-accent
--team-ink
--team-soft
```

This keeps personalization flexible without letting team color take over the app. It also makes future team additions straightforward: add a data record, and the UI inherits the theme.

## Why JSON-render Is Used Carefully

The project uses `@json-render/core` and `@json-render/react`, but only as a constrained presentation layer.

The important boundary is this:

- JSON-render controls section composition and registered UI actions.
- React and typed domain code own prediction, draw, fulfillment, and review state.

That split came from the design study. JSON-render is useful for catalog-first UI, generated modules, and controlled layout variation. It is not the right source of truth for anything involving prizes, eligibility, audit trails, fulfillment, or compliance.

The JSON-render catalog lives in `src/jsonRender/predictionCatalog.tsx`. It defines product-specific components:

- `MatchBoard`
- `DrawControl`
- `ShirtStudio`
- `FulfillmentPipeline`
- `RewardSummary`
- `ProviderPlan`

The JSON spec decides which sections appear, but action handlers still call deterministic state updates.

## The Prediction System

The prediction flow is intentionally simple in the prototype:

1. Pick a match winner or draw.
2. Set the scoreline.
3. Lock the prediction.
4. Run a seeded demo draw after a demo result.

Demo match data includes a `winnerSlots` number and a deterministic `demoResult`. Community entries are seeded in local data so draw behavior is repeatable during testing.

The draw result includes:

- final result label
- eligible entry count
- winners
- exact-score flag
- prize description
- fulfillment status

This is enough to demonstrate the flow without pretending to have production scoring, fraud checks, official results, or legal eligibility rules.

## Sponsor Rewards And Fulfillment

The rewards model separates the fan-facing prize from the operational flow.

Fan-facing rewards include:

- sponsor gift collections
- exact-score bonus credit draws
- supporter streak boosts
- free localized T-shirts

Operationally, the prototype shows:

- shipment queue count
- review prompt count
- match-level queue actions
- match-level review actions

This is deliberately visible because sponsor rewards need auditability. A future production system should store immutable records for prediction, result, eligibility, draw, claim, shipment, delivery, and review prompt events.

## Localized T-Shirts

The T-shirt system uses independent fan designs rather than official jerseys. That matters because official tournament marks, federation crests, player names, mascot imagery, trophy imagery, and sponsor marks generally require licensing.

Current T-shirt concepts cover:

- Brazil: Canary Street Rhythm
- Argentina: Skyline Albiceleste
- United States: Stateside Rally
- France: Bleu Moderne
- England: Terrace Rose Abstract
- Spain: La Roja Rhythm
- Morocco: Atlas Pulse
- Japan: Rising Motion

Each concept includes motif, print copy, alternate copy, colors, and a no-official-branding disclaimer.

## Print-On-Demand And Sponsor Package Research

The print-on-demand research led to a practical split:

- Use Gelato first for global-local winner T-shirts.
- Use Printful when branded control, mockups, webhooks, and light warehousing matter more.
- Treat Printify as a cost lever, not the main operational backbone.
- Use a separate 3PL or kitting partner for real sponsor product packages.

The key learning: POD pack-ins are not a substitute for real sponsor-product fulfillment. Sponsor boxes need inventory receiving, SKU controls, customs handling, tracking, and delivery events.

## Stripe Projects And Infrastructure

Projects.dev, also known as Stripe Projects, was researched for project operations. It is useful for provisioning and managing development infrastructure, credentials, providers, and spend limits.

Current external project status from the sub-agent:

- `World Cup` Projects.dev project exists.
- Stripe Projects auth works.
- Neon free plan is provisioned.
- Neon Postgres service exists as `primary-db`.
- WorkOS AuthKit sandbox service exists as `auth`.
- PostHog account is linked, but its service setup is incomplete.
- Vercel is blocked by Vercel-side signup verification.
- Cloudflare, Sentry, and spend limits are not configured yet.

Projects.dev should support the build stack. It should not be treated as the contest, payment, compliance, fulfillment, or vendor-payment system.

## Impeccable-Inspired Design Pass

The site was later refined using `https://impeccable.style/designing/` as a design workflow reference.

The useful lesson was not to clone the visual style. The useful lesson was to document product/design context and then use that context to tighten the layout.

That pass added:

- `PRODUCT.md`
- `DESIGN.md`
- desktop workflow rail
- cleaner product-state empty copy
- corrected section anchors
- stronger matchday operations framing

The workspace now has a clearer flow:

1. Predict
2. Draw
3. Personalize
4. Fulfill
5. Review

## Verification So Far

The project has been verified with:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Browser checks have covered:

- team switching
- prediction selection
- score inputs
- lock state
- seeded match draw
- winner rendering
- fulfillment queue actions
- review prompt actions
- workflow rail copy
- console error checks

## Commit Timeline

### `1d190e6` - Initial World Cup predictor prototype

Built the first working React prototype with supporter team theming, predictions, seeded draws, reward previews, T-shirt concepts, provider recommendations, and the initial build log in `AGENTS.md`.

### `d2592fe` - Enhance product layout with design workflow

Added the Impeccable-inspired design workflow, `PRODUCT.md`, `DESIGN.md`, persistent workflow rail, cleaner empty states, and updated verification artifacts.

### Current commit - Add build blog artifact

Added this file so the build can be turned into a public article over time. Also updated the project workflow so future commits update both `AGENTS.md` and this blog artifact.

## Next Build Steps

The prototype needs several production layers before it can become a real campaign:

- database persistence for users, predictions, draws, shipments, and reviews
- authentication through WorkOS or another provider
- official rules, no-purchase route, age/location eligibility, and compliance review
- admin tooling for sponsors, matches, product SKUs, and fulfillment batches
- real POD integration for T-shirt orders
- real 3PL/kitting integration for sponsor boxes
- analytics events for prediction, draw, claim, delivery, and review funnels
- mobile and tablet visual verification

## Maintenance Rule

Every commit should update this file with:

- what changed
- why the change was made
- which files or systems were affected
- what verification was run
- what the next relevant build step is
